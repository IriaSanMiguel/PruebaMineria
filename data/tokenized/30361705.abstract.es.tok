although rectal neuroendocrine tumours are rare neoplasms their incidence is increasing in the last three decades the objective of this work is to study the behaviour of these tumours based on their clinical diagnostic therapeutic and pathological variab in tertiary hospital we found 16 patients with ano rectal neuroendocrine tumour 75 were male the mediar age was 53 years range 34 83 the diagnosis was incidental in 62 5 with endoscopic treatment in 13 patients 81 and surgical treatment in 3 19 75 of the lesions were t1 68 7 of the tumours showed degreir of g1 aggression the mear follow up was 29 months recurrenz during follow up three patients died 18 5 all of them with metastatic g3 tumour and the mear survival was 8 months estudiar retrospectivo tumor neuroendocrino rectal año 2000 año 2017 hospital realizar busqueda informatizado programa snomed servicio anatomia patologico emplear criterio « tumor neuroendocrino » « tumor carcinoidar » aunque tumor neuroendocrino rectal ser neoplasia frecuente incidencia aumentar tres ultimo decada objetivo trabajo ser estudio comportamiento dicho tumor basandono variable clinico diagnostico terapeutico anatomopatologica hospital terciario hallar 16 paciente tumor neuroendocrino ano rectal 75 ser varon mediana edad ser 53 año ranguir 34 83 diagnostico ser incidental 62 5 tratamiento ser endoscopico 13 81 paciente quirurgico 3 19 75 lesion ser t1 68 7 tumor presentar grado agresividad g1 media seguimiento ser 29 mes haber recidiva seguimiento fallecer 3 18 5 paciente tumor g3 metastasico supervivencia medio ser 8 mes retrospective study of rectal neuroendocrine tumours from 2000 to 2017 in our hospital computerized search was performed in the snomed program of the pathological anatomy service using the criteria “ neuroendocrine tumour ” and “ carcinoid tumour ” the rectal neuroendocrine tumours are increasingly frequent and present variable patterns whose prognosis will depend on their histological aggressiveness the increar incidence may be due to greater awareness of the existence of these tumours to colorectal cancer screening to the increar in the number of colonoscopies performed and to the generalization of histological studies with neuroendocrine marker tumor neuroendocrino rectal ser cada vez frecuente presentar patron variable cuyo pronostico depender agresividad histologico aumento incidencia poder deber mayor concienciacion existencia tumor campaña cribado cancer colorrectal aumento numero colonoscopia realizado generalizacion estudio histologico marcador neuroendocrino
