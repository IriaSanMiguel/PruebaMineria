programa entrenamiento simulado permitir optimizar recurso aumentar practica tecnico acortar curva aprendizaje constituir metodo seguro estandarizado validado aprendizaje entrenado desarrollar programa entrenamiento vascular mediante elaboracion anastomosis termino terminal vaso modelo experimental residente cirugia general reconocer ventaja entrenamiento experimental proponer modelo biologico experimental reproducible estandarizado bajo costo the development of experimental biological models allows the general surgeon the acquisition of surgical skills and abilities improving performance during surgical procedure and reducing risks simulated training programs allow to optimize resources increase technical practice and shortar learning curv constituting safe standardized and validated method of learning for all tho trained develop vascular training program through the elaboration of an end to end anastomosis of vessel in an experimental model for general surgery resident desarrollo modelo biologico experimental permitir cirujano general adquisicion habilidad destreza quirurgico mejorar desempeño procedimiento quirurgico reducir riesgo for the development of this training model an amputated limb was used at the supracondylar level free of medical legal process the dissection of the femoral artery was performed it was divided into two portions and an end to end anastomosis was performed system was designed that included the evaluation of the following variable using the osats objective structured assessment of technical skills and likert scal 1 manual knot and single stitch 2 permeability of the anastomosis 3 symmetry of the stitches 4 anastomosis leakage and 5 total time of the anastomosis desarrollo modelo entrenamiento utilizar extremidad amputado nivel supracondileo libre proceso medico legal realizar diseccion arteria femoral dividir dos porcion realizar anastomosis termino terminal diseñar sistema incluir evaluacion siguiente variable utlizar escala osats objetive structured assesment of technical skills likert 1 nudo manual punto simple 2 permeabilidad anastomosis 3 simeter punto 4 fuga anastomosis 5 tiempo total anastomosis recognizing the advantages of experimental training reproducible standardized and low cost experimental biological model is proposed
